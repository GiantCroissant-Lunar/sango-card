# Partial Class Organization (R-CODE-090)
# Each interface implementation should be in a separate partial class file
# File naming: ClassName.InterfaceName.cs (without 'I' prefix)
# Base file (Build.cs): partial class Build : NukeBuild
# Interface file (Build.UnityBuild.cs): partial class Build : IUnityBuild
# Interface members implemented in interface-specific file
# Enforced by: Code review, future Roslyn analyzer, pre-commit hooks
