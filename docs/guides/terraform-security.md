# Security Guide - SOPS & Terraform

Security best practices for managing encrypted secrets in the sango-card infrastructure.

## Security Layers

### 1. Encryption at Rest (SOPS + age)

**What's Encrypted:**

- Unity licenses and credentials
- GitHub tokens and API keys
- Android/iOS signing certificates
- All sensitive repository secrets

**How It Works:**

```
Plaintext JSON ‚Üí age encryption ‚Üí SOPS metadata ‚Üí Encrypted file
     ‚Üì                                                    ‚Üì
  Gitignored                                      Committed to git
```

**Age Encryption:**

- Modern, secure encryption (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Public key encryption (like SSH keys)
- Small encrypted files (~2x original size)
- Fast encryption/decryption

### 2. Access Control (age keys)

**Private Key Security:**

- Stored locally only (`secrets/age.key`)
- Never committed to git (`.gitignore` protected)
- Needed only for decryption
- Should be backed up securely

**Public Key:**

- Safe to share and commit (in `.sops.yaml`)
- Used only for encryption
- Can be regenerated anytime

### 3. Git Protection (Pre-commit Hooks)

**Automated Checks:**

1. **Plaintext secrets detection** - Blocks commit if unencrypted secrets detected
2. **Age key detection** - Prevents committing private keys
3. **SOPS validation** - Ensures `.sops.yaml` has real key, not placeholder
4. **Secret scanning** - Gitleaks and detect-secrets integration

**Manual Override (NOT RECOMMENDED):**

```powershell
# NEVER do this unless you know exactly what you're doing
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

### 4. CI/CD Security (GitHub Actions)

**Secret Storage:**

- Age private key stored in GitHub Secrets (`SOPS_AGE_KEY`)
- Encrypted at rest by GitHub
- Only available to workflows
- Redacted in logs

**Runtime Security:**

- Secrets decrypted in memory only
- Files written to ephemeral runners
- Automatic cleanup after job completes
- No secrets in build artifacts

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO

**Key Management:**

- ‚úÖ Generate unique age keys per team member (optional)
- ‚úÖ Back up age key to secure password manager
- ‚úÖ Rotate age keys annually
- ‚úÖ Use strong passphrases if encrypting age key

**Secret Management:**

- ‚úÖ Always encrypt secrets before committing
- ‚úÖ Use descriptive names for secrets (non-sensitive)
- ‚úÖ Review encrypted diffs before committing
- ‚úÖ Audit who has access to `SOPS_AGE_KEY` GitHub secret

**Operational:**

- ‚úÖ Run pre-commit hooks on every commit
- ‚úÖ Use `.\Encrypt-Secrets.ps1 -Force` when updating
- ‚úÖ Test decryption locally before pushing
- ‚úÖ Monitor GitHub Actions logs for suspicious activity

**Team Collaboration:**

- ‚úÖ Share only public keys (in `.sops.yaml`)
- ‚úÖ Use separate age keys per environment (dev/staging/prod)
- ‚úÖ Document key rotation procedures
- ‚úÖ Revoke access by removing public keys and re-encrypting

### ‚ùå DON'T

**Never Commit:**

- ‚ùå `secrets/age.key` (private key)
- ‚ùå `secrets/*.json` (plaintext secrets)
- ‚ùå `github/terraform.tfvars` (generated variables)
- ‚ùå `.terraform.tfstate` (state files)

**Never Share:**

- ‚ùå Private age keys via Slack/email/chat
- ‚ùå Screenshots showing plaintext secrets
- ‚ùå Terraform plan outputs with sensitive data
- ‚ùå GitHub `SOPS_AGE_KEY` secret value

**Never Do:**

- ‚ùå Skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`)
- ‚ùå Commit plaintext secrets "temporarily"
- ‚ùå Store age key in code repository
- ‚ùå Use the same key for multiple environments

## Threat Model

### What SOPS Protects Against

‚úÖ **Accidental commits** - Plaintext secrets in git history  
‚úÖ **Repository access** - Attackers with repo access can't read secrets  
‚úÖ **Public repository exposure** - Safe to open-source (with secrets encrypted)  
‚úÖ **CI/CD compromise** - Even with repo access, can't decrypt without key  
‚úÖ **Developer laptop theft** - Encrypted files are useless without age key  

### What SOPS Does NOT Protect Against

‚ùå **Compromised age key** - If attacker gets key, can decrypt all secrets  
‚ùå **Compromised CI/CD** - If `SOPS_AGE_KEY` GitHub secret is stolen  
‚ùå **Memory dumps** - Secrets in memory during Terraform runs  
‚ùå **Terraform state** - State may contain secrets in plaintext  
‚ùå **Logging** - Accidental logging of decrypted secrets  

### Additional Protections

**For Terraform State:**

- Use Terraform Cloud (encrypted at rest)
- Or use S3 with encryption enabled
- Never commit `.tfstate` files
- Limit access to state storage

**For CI/CD:**

- Restrict who can modify workflows
- Use branch protection rules
- Require PR reviews for infrastructure changes
- Enable GitHub Actions audit log

**For Logging:**

- Redact sensitive values in logs
- Disable verbose logging in production
- Review logs for accidental secret exposure
- Use `sensitive = true` in Terraform variables

## Key Rotation

### When to Rotate

- üîÑ Annually (proactive)
- üîÑ When team member leaves
- üîÑ If key is compromised
- üîÑ If key is accidentally exposed

### Rotation Process

1. **Generate new key:**

   ```powershell
   cd infra\terraform\scripts
   .\New-AgeKeyPair.ps1 -OutFile ..\secrets\age-new.key
   ```

2. **Add new public key to `.sops.yaml`** (keep old):

   ```yaml
   creation_rules:
     - age:
         - "age1old_key_here"      # Keep old key
         - "age1new_key_here"      # Add new key
   ```

3. **Re-encrypt with both keys:**

   ```powershell
   .\Encrypt-Secrets.ps1 -Force
   git add ..\secrets\*.encrypted ..\.sops.yaml
   git commit -m "chore(security): rotate age key"
   git push
   ```

4. **Update GitHub secret:**
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí `SOPS_AGE_KEY`
   - Update with contents of `secrets/age-new.key`

5. **Verify CI/CD works** with new key

6. **Remove old public key from `.sops.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   creation_rules:
     - age:
         - "age1new_key_here"      # Only new key
   ```

7. **Re-encrypt to remove old key:**

   ```powershell
   .\Encrypt-Secrets.ps1 -Force
   git add ..\secrets\*.encrypted ..\.sops.yaml
   git commit -m "chore(security): remove old age key"
   git push
   ```

8. **Securely delete old key:**

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item ..\secrets\age.key -Force
   Rename-Item ..\secrets\age-new.key age.key
   ```

## Incident Response

### If Age Key is Compromised

1. **Immediate:**
   - Generate new age key pair
   - Update `.sops.yaml` with new key only
   - Re-encrypt all secrets
   - Push to git immediately

2. **Within 1 hour:**
   - Rotate all secrets (GitHub tokens, Unity licenses, etc.)
   - Update GitHub `SOPS_AGE_KEY` secret
   - Notify team members
   - Review git history for suspicious commits

3. **Within 24 hours:**
   - Audit who had access
   - Review CI/CD logs
   - Document incident
   - Update security procedures

### If Plaintext Secret is Committed

1. **Immediate:**
   - DO NOT just delete the file and commit
   - Secret is now in git history permanently
   - Rotate the compromised secret immediately

2. **Clean git history** (if repository is private):

   ```powershell
   # Use BFG Repo Cleaner or git filter-repo
   # WARNING: This rewrites history
   git filter-repo --path secrets/terraform-secrets.json --invert-paths
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

3. **If repository is public:**
   - Assume secret is compromised
   - Rotate immediately
   - Consider repository as tainted
   - May need to create new repository

## Compliance

### Audit Trail

**What's Tracked:**

- ‚úÖ When secrets were updated (git commits)
- ‚úÖ Who encrypted secrets (git author)
- ‚úÖ When keys were rotated (git history)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD deployments (GitHub Actions logs)

**What's NOT Tracked:**

- ‚ùå Who decrypted secrets locally
- ‚ùå How many times secrets were accessed
- ‚ùå Who viewed GitHub `SOPS_AGE_KEY` secret

### GDPR / Data Privacy

**Personal Data:**

- Unity email addresses may be personal data
- Age keys are not personal data (cryptographic keys)

**Data Retention:**

- Encrypted secrets stored in git indefinitely
- Plaintext secrets never stored in git
- CI/CD logs retained per GitHub settings (default: 90 days)

**Right to be Forgotten:**

- Remove user's public key from `.sops.yaml`
- Re-encrypt secrets to revoke access
- No need to delete git history (only encrypted data)
