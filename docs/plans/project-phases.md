# Project Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Build System Foundation (Completed 2025-10-16)

### Objectives

- Establish foundational build infrastructure
- Implement build preparation tooling
- Set up Unity package dependencies
- Create cross-package dependency management

### Outcomes

- ‚úÖ Nuke build system integrated
- ‚úÖ Build preparation tool designed (RFC-001, SPEC-BPT-001)
- ‚úÖ Unity package structure created (scoped registries)
- ‚úÖ Path resolution strategy defined (git root-based)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft.Extensions.* packages integrated

### Technical Deliverables

- `build/nuke/` - Nuke build automation
- `packages/scoped-6571/com.contractwork.sangocard.build/` - Build package
- `.specify/specs/build-preparation-tool.md` - Tool specification
- Path resolution system (R-PATH-010)

### Revised Milestones

The initial phase went through multiple iterations to refine the approach:

**Iteration 1 (PHASE1-COMPLETE.md):**

- Initial design with basic path resolution
- Simple JSON configuration

**Iteration 2 (PHASE1-REVISED-COMPLETE.md):**

- Enhanced with reactive architecture
- Added MessagePipe for event handling
- Improved validation strategy

**Iteration 3 (PHASE1-FINAL.md):**

- Final design with Terminal.Gui v2
- Git root-based path resolution (critical fix)
- Roslyn-based code patching
- Complete TUI/CLI dual-mode architecture

### Lessons Learned

1. **Path ambiguity was critical** - Git root resolution solved multi-environment issues
2. **Reactive architecture essential** - MessagePipe + ReactiveUI provides clean separation
3. **TUI valuable for development** - Terminal.Gui v2 provides better UX than pure CLI
4. **Roslyn necessary** - Text-based patching insufficient for C# code modifications

## Phase 2: Core Tool Implementation (In Progress)

### Objectives

- Implement build preparation tool
- Create CLI and TUI modes
- Implement all code patchers
- Integrate with Nuke build system

### Current Status (as of 2025-10-17)

- üèóÔ∏è Project structure created
- üèóÔ∏è Core models defined
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Services implementation pending
- ‚è∏Ô∏è CLI commands pending
- ‚è∏Ô∏è TUI views pending

### Milestones

   - [ ] ConfigService implementation
   - [ ] CacheService implementation
   - [ ] ValidationService implementation
   - [ ] PathResolver with git root detection

2. **M2.2: Code Patchers** (Week 3)
   - [ ] CSharpPatcher (Roslyn)
   - [ ] JsonPatcher
   - [ ] UnityAssetPatcher
   - [ ] TextPatcher
   - [ ] Unit tests (80% coverage)

3. **M2.3: CLI Mode** (Week 4)
   - [ ] System.CommandLine setup
   - [ ] Config commands
   - [ ] Cache commands
   - [ ] Prepare commands
   - [ ] Integration tests

4. **M2.4: TUI Mode** (Week 5)
   - [ ] Terminal.Gui v2 setup
   - [ ] MainWindow
   - [ ] CacheManagementView
   - [ ] ConfigEditorView
   - [ ] ValidationView

5. **M2.5: Integration** (Week 6)
   - [ ] Nuke build system integration
   - [ ] End-to-end testing
   - [ ] Documentation
   - [ ] Training materials

## Phase 3: Unity Client Development (Planned)

### Objectives

- Implement card game core mechanics
- Create UI/UX systems
- Implement multiplayer infrastructure
- Build player progression systems

### Target Timeline

Start: After Phase 2 completion
Duration: 12-16 weeks

### High-Level Milestones

1. Core game systems (4 weeks)
2. UI/UX implementation (4 weeks)
3. Multiplayer systems (4 weeks)
4. Polish and optimization (2-4 weeks)

## Phase 4: Content and Balancing (Planned)

### Objectives

- Create card assets and content
- Balance game mechanics
- Implement economy systems
- Create tutorial and onboarding

### Target Timeline

Start: Concurrent with late Phase 3
Duration: 8-10 weeks

## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

**R1: Tool Complexity**

- **Impact:** High
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Incremental delivery, extensive testing, clear documentation
- **Status:** Mitigated through phased approach

**R2: Unity YAML Parsing**

- **Impact:** High
- **Probability:** High
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple cases, fallback to text-based patching
- **Status:** Under investigation

**R3: Terminal.Gui v2 Stability**

- **Impact:** Medium
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Report issues upstream, CLI-only fallback available
- **Status:** Monitoring

### Medium-Priority Risks

**R4: Developer Adoption**

- **Impact:** Medium
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Training, documentation, TUI for ease of use
- **Status:** Mitigated

**R5: Cross-Platform Compatibility**

- **Impact:** Medium
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Test on Windows/Linux/macOS, document platform differences
- **Status:** Pending testing

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Completed)

- ‚úÖ Build system operational
- ‚úÖ Specification complete and approved
- ‚úÖ Path resolution strategy validated
- ‚úÖ Architecture designed and reviewed

### Phase 2 (In Progress)

- Build preparation completes in < 30 seconds
- Tool adoption by 100% of team within 2 weeks
- 99% preparation success rate
- 80% code coverage
- < 5 bugs per month after GA

### Future Phases

(Metrics TBD based on phase requirements)
