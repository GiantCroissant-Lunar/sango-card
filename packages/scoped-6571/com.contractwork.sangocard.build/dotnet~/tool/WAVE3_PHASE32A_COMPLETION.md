**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Phase:** Wave 3 Phase 3.2a - Preparation Sources Management Screen  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Objectives

Create a dedicated CRUD screen for managing Phase 1 preparation source configs (PreparationManifest).

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created PreparationSourcesManagementView ✅

**File:** `Tui/Views/PreparationSourcesManagementView.cs`

A comprehensive management screen for Phase 1 source collection manifests with full CRUD operations.

**Features:**

#### Manifest Operations
- **Load Manifest** - Browse and load existing preparation manifests
- **New Manifest** - Create new manifests with custom ID, title, and cache directory
- **Save Manifest** - Save changes to disk
- Auto-creates directory structure if needed

#### Item Management (Full CRUD)
- **Add Item** - Add packages, assemblies, or assets with:
  - Type selection (Package/Assembly/Asset)
  - Source path with file browser
  - Cache name (auto-filled from source)
  - Validation for duplicates
- **Edit Item** - Modify existing items
- **Remove Item** - Remove items with confirmation dialog
- **Preview Operations** - View all operations before execution

#### User Experience
- ListView displaying all items with format: `[TYPE] cacheName ← sourcePath`
- Item count display
- Status messages for all operations
- Validation with helpful error messages
- Browse dialogs for easy file selection
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

### 2. Integrated into TUI Navigation ✅

**Modified Files:**
- `HostBuilderExtensions.cs` - Registered PreparationSourcesManagementView
- `TuiHost.cs` - Added new "Manage" menu

**New Navigation Structure:**

#### Menu Bar - New "Manage" Menu
- **File** - Open/Save configs
- **View** - Switch between views  
- **Manage** (NEW)
  - Preparation Sources (Phase 1) - Opens the new view
  - Build Injections (Phase 2) - Placeholder for next phase
- **Help** - Documentation and about

### 3. Updated Documentation ✅

**Welcome Screen:**
- Updated workflow guide to mention new Manage menu
- Clarified distinction between quick add (F5) and full management (Manage menu)
- Updated status to show Phase 3.2a complete

**Help Dialog:**
- Added Manage menu documentation
- Updated workflow to recommend Manage menu for full CRUD
- Explained menu structure

**About Dialog:**
- Updated to show 7 TUI views
- Added "Preparation Sources (Full CRUD)" to features list
- Shows Phase 3.2b as in progress

## Technical Details

### Architecture

**Service Integration:**
- Uses `SourceManagementService` for all manifest operations
- Leverages `PathResolver` for path resolution
- Integrated with MessagePipe for reactive updates

**Data Model:**
- Works with `PreparationManifest` model
- Manages `PreparationItem` collections
- Supports all three item types (package, assembly, asset)

**UI Patterns:**
- Follows Terminal.Gui v2 conventions
- Consistent with existing views
- Modal dialogs for add/edit operations
- List-based item display with selection

### Build Status
- ✅ Clean build with only pre-existing warnings
- ✅ No new errors introduced
- ✅ All views properly registered

### Code Quality
- Proper error handling with try-catch
- Validation before operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- IDisposable pattern for subscriptions

## User Workflows

### Create New Manifest Workflow
1. Click "New" button
2. Enter manifest path, ID, and title
3. Click "Create"
4. Add items as needed
5. Click "Save"

### Add Item Workflow
1. Load or create manifest
2. Click "Add Item"
3. Select type (Package/Assembly/Asset)
4. Browse for source or enter path
5. Review auto-filled cache name (edit if needed)
6. Click "Add"
7. Click "Save" to persist changes

### Edit/Remove Workflow
1. Load manifest
2. Select item from list
3. Click "Edit Item" or "Remove Item"
4. Make changes or confirm removal
5. Click "Save" to persist changes

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ View accessible from Manage menu
- ✅ All dialogs render correctly
- ✅ File browser integration works

### Functional Areas Tested
- ✅ Manifest load/create/save operations
- ✅ Item add/edit/remove operations
- ✅ Validation logic
- ✅ UI rendering and layout
- ✅ Menu integration

## Comparison: Manual Sources vs Preparation Sources Management

### ManualSourcesView (Quick Add - F5)
- **Purpose:** Quick addition of individual sources
- **Workflow:** Single-screen, wizard-style
- **Best For:** Adding one or two items quickly
- **Operations:** Add, View, Remove (basic)

### PreparationSourcesManagementView (Full CRUD - Manage Menu)
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive manifest management
- **Workflow:** Multi-screen with dedicated dialogs
- **Best For:** Managing entire manifests
- **Operations:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Additional:** Manifest metadata, preview, validation

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Wave 3 Phase 3.2b (3 hours)
**Build Injections Management Screen**

Create similar CRUD screen for Phase 2 configs:
- BuildInjectionsManagementView.cs
- Manage build injection mappings (cache → client)
- Code patcher configuration UI
- Integration with ConfigService

### After 3.2b: Wave 3 Phase 3.3 (4 hours)
**Integration Testing**

End-to-end testing of all TUI functionality.

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
1. `Tui/Views/PreparationSourcesManagementView.cs` - New management view (655 lines)

**Modified:**
1. `HostBuilderExtensions.cs` - Service registration
2. `TuiHost.cs` - Menu structure and navigation

## Summary

Wave 3 Phase 3.2a is complete. The TUI now has a comprehensive CRUD interface for managing Phase 1 preparation source manifests. Users can create, load, edit, and save manifests with full item management capabilities.

The distinction between quick addition (ManualSourcesView) and full management (PreparationSourcesManagementView) provides flexibility for different use cases.

**Total Time Invested:** ~3 hours (as planned)
**Build Status:** ✅ Success
**Code Quality:** ✅ High
**Integration:** ✅ Complete
**User Experience:** ✅ Comprehensive

Ready to proceed to Phase 3.2b - Build Injections Management Screen.
