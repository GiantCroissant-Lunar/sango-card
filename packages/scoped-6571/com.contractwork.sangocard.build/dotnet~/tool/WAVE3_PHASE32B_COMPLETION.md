# Wave 3 Phase 3.2b Completion Report

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Phase:** Wave 3 Phase 3.2b - Build Injections Management Screen  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Objectives

Create a dedicated CRUD screen for managing Phase 2 build injection configs (PreparationConfig - cache → client mappings).

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created BuildInjectionsManagementView ✅

**File:** `Tui/Views/BuildInjectionsManagementView.cs`

A comprehensive management screen for Phase 2 build injection configs with full CRUD operations across all injection types.

**Features:**

#### Config Operations
- **Load Config** - Browse and load existing build preparation configs
- **New Config** - Create new configs with description
- **Save Config** - Save changes to disk
- Auto-creates directory structure if needed

#### Multi-Section Management
**Section Selector (Radio Buttons):**
- Packages - Unity package injections (.tgz files)
- Assemblies - DLL assembly injections
- Assets - Asset manipulation operations

Each section has independent item lists with full CRUD operations.

#### Item Management (Full CRUD for all 3 types)

**Packages:**
- Name, version, source (from cache), target (to client)
- Example: `com.unity.addressables v1.21.2`
- Auto-fill examples and validation

**Assemblies:**
- Name, optional version, source, target
- Example: `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`
- Supports plugins directory injection

**Assets:**
- Operation type (Copy/Move/Delete)
- Source and target paths
- Asset manipulation workflows

#### User Experience
- Section-based navigation with radio buttons
- ListView showing all items in current section
- Item format varies by type:
  - Packages: `name vversion | source → target`
  - Assemblies: `name vversion | source → target`
  - Assets: `[OPERATION] source → target`
- Item count per section
- Status messages for all operations
- Preview all operations before execution
- Validation with helpful error messages
- File browser integration
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

### 2. Integrated into TUI Navigation ✅

**Modified Files:**
- `HostBuilderExtensions.cs` - Registered BuildInjectionsManagementView
- `TuiHost.cs` - Updated Manage menu

**Updated Manage Menu:**
- Manage → Preparation Sources (Phase 1) - Existing
- Manage → Build Injections (Phase 2) - NEW! (fully functional)

### 3. Updated Documentation ✅

**Welcome Screen:**
- Updated Phase 2 workflow to show full CRUD screen
- Updated menu shortcuts to show both Manage options
- Updated features list to include Build Injections Management
- Updated status to show 8 views and Wave 3.2 complete

**Help Dialog:**
- Updated Manage menu documentation to show both phases as available
- Updated workflow to include Build Injections step
- Clarified both phases are now fully functional

**About Dialog:**
- Updated to show 8 TUI views
- Added "Build Injections (Full CRUD)" to features list
- Shows Wave 3.2 as complete

## Technical Details

### Architecture

**Service Integration:**
- Uses `ConfigService` for all config operations
- Leverages `PathResolver` for path resolution
- Integrated with MessagePipe for reactive updates
- Subscribes to ConfigLoadedMessage and ConfigSavedMessage

**Data Model:**
- Works with `PreparationConfig` model
- Manages three collection types:
  - `List<UnityPackageReference>` for packages
  - `List<AssemblyReference>` for assemblies
  - `List<AssetManipulation>` for assets
- Uses `AssetOperation` enum (Copy, Move, Delete)

**UI Patterns:**
- Section-based interface with RadioGroup selector
- Follows Terminal.Gui v2 conventions
- Consistent with PreparationSourcesManagementView
- Modal dialogs for add/edit operations
- List-based item display with dynamic content

### Build Status
- ✅ Clean build with only pre-existing warnings
- ✅ No new errors introduced
- ✅ All views properly registered

### Code Quality
- Proper error handling with try-catch
- Validation before operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- IDisposable pattern for subscriptions
- Enum handling for AssetOperation

## Comparison: All 3 Management Screens

### ManualSourcesView (Quick Add - F5)
- **Purpose:** Quick addition of individual sources
- **Scope:** Phase 1 only (source collection)
- **Best For:** Adding 1-2 items quickly

### PreparationSourcesManagementView (Manage Menu - Phase 1)
- **Purpose:** Full manifest management
- **Scope:** Phase 1 (source → cache)
- **Data:** PreparationManifest
- **Best For:** Managing source collection workflows

### BuildInjectionsManagementView (Manage Menu - Phase 2)
- **Purpose:** Full config management
- **Scope:** Phase 2 (cache → client)
- **Data:** PreparationConfig (packages, assemblies, assets)
- **Best For:** Managing build injection workflows
- **Unique:** Multi-section interface for different injection types

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Wave 3 Phase 3.3 (4 hours)
**Integration Testing & Polish**

Tasks:
- End-to-end testing of all TUI views
- Test navigation flow between all 8 views
- Test state management across views
- Test both Phase 1 and Phase 2 workflows end-to-end
- Memory leak testing (dispose patterns)
- Error handling verification
- Performance testing
- Bug fixes and polish

### Parallel: Wave 4 Documentation (3 hours)
**Can run while Wave 3.3 is in progress**

Tasks:
- Update tool README with all TUI features
- Create comprehensive user guide
- Document two-phase workflow with screenshots
- Add usage examples for all views
- Create migration guide from CLI to TUI
- Update command reference
- Add troubleshooting section

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
1. `Tui/Views/BuildInjectionsManagementView.cs` - New management view (900+ lines)

**Modified:**
1. `HostBuilderExtensions.cs` - Service registration
2. `TuiHost.cs` - Menu updates and navigation

## Summary

Wave 3 Phase 3.2b is complete. The TUI now has comprehensive CRUD interfaces for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the build preparation workflow.

**Phase 1 Management (Preparation Sources):**
- Manage source collection from external locations
- Define what goes into cache

**Phase 2 Management (Build Injections - NEW):**
- Manage injection mappings from cache to client
- Handle packages, assemblies, and asset manipulations
- Section-based interface for different injection types

Both phases now have:
- Full CRUD operations
- Professional UX with validation
- File browser integration
- Preview capabilities
- Comprehensive error handling

**Total Time Invested:** ~3 hours (as planned)
**Build Status:** ✅ Success
**Code Quality:** ✅ High
**Integration:** ✅ Complete
**User Experience:** ✅ Comprehensive

**Wave 3 Phase 3.2 (Management Screens):** ✅ COMPLETE!

Ready to proceed to Phase 3.3 - Integration Testing and final polish.
