## 🎯 Recommended Agent Assignment

### Agent A (Lead/Integration)
- Complete Wave 3.2 (both phases)
- Then Wave 3.3 (integration testing)

### Agent D (Documentation)
- Start Wave 4 immediately (parallel to 3.2)
- Can complete while Wave 3.2 is in progress

### Benefits of Parallel Approach
- Wave 4 can complete in ~3 hours
- Wave 3.2 can complete in ~6 hours
- Both done in ~6 hours total (50% time savings)
- Wave 3.3 testing can start immediately after 3.2
