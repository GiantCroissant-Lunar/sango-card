# Task 4.3 Completion Summary

**Task:** Prepare Command Group Implementation  
**Wave:** 7 (CLI & TUI Foundation)  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Estimated Time:** 12 hours  
**Actual Time:** ~1 hour (AI-assisted, built on existing infrastructure)

## Implemented Features

### All 3 Prepare Subcommands

#### 1. prepare run ✅ ENHANCED

- **Method:** `RunAsync(string configRelativePath, string validationLevel = "full", bool verbose = false, bool force = false)`
- **Functionality:** Executes the full build preparation workflow
- **Features:**
  - **Validation:** Validates config before execution with configurable level
  - **Force Mode:** `--force` flag to proceed despite validation errors
  - **Verbose Mode:** `--verbose` flag for detailed output
  - **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with specific exit codes
  - **Progress Reporting:** Shows operation counts and duration
  - **Backup Creation:** Automatically creates backup before modifications
  - **Rollback:** Auto-rollback on error
  - **Performance Tracking:** Reports execution time
  - **Detailed Results:**
    - Files copied
    - Files moved
    - Files deleted
    - Patches applied
    - Total duration
  - **Exit Codes:**
    - 0 = Success
    - 1 = Config file not found
    - 2 = Validation failed (without --force)
    - 3 = Preparation execution error

**Enhanced Output:**

```
=== Validation Results ===
Validation passed: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

=== Starting Preparation ===
Config: D:\...\build\preparation\configs\dev.json

=== Preparation Complete ===
Duration: 2.34s
Files copied: 5
Files moved: 0
Files deleted: 0
Patches applied: 3
```

#### 2. prepare dry-run ✅ NEW

- **Method:** `DryRunAsync(string configRelativePath, string validationLevel = "full", bool verbose = false)`
- **Functionality:** Simulates preparation without modifying any files
- **Features:**
  - **Safe Testing:** No file modifications, perfect for validation
  - **Full Validation:** Validates config before simulation
  - **Detailed Preview:** Shows exactly what would happen
  - **Performance Estimate:** Reports how long actual run would take
  - **Verbose Mode:** `--verbose` flag for detailed output
  - **Result Preview:**
    - Files that would be copied
    - Files that would be moved
    - Files that would be deleted
    - Patches that would be applied
    - Estimated duration
  - **Clear Messaging:** Explicitly states no files were modified
  - **Exit Codes:**
    - 0 = Success (dry-run completed)
    - 1 = Config file not found
    - 2 = Validation failed
    - 3 = Dry-run execution error

**Output Example:**

```
=== Validation Results ===
Validation passed: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

=== DRY-RUN MODE (no files will be modified) ===

=== Dry-Run Results ===
Duration: 1.87s
Files that would be copied: 5
Files that would be moved: 0
Files that would be deleted: 0
Patches that would be applied: 3

Total operations: 8

No files were actually modified (dry-run mode).
```

#### 3. prepare restore ✅ NEW

- **Method:** `RestoreAsync(string? backupPath = null, bool verbose = false)`
- **Functionality:** Restores files from backup
- **Features:**
  - **Automatic Backup Detection:** Uses last backup if no path specified
  - **Manual Backup Selection:** Can specify custom backup path
  - **Verbose Mode:** `--verbose` flag for detailed output
  - **Complete Restoration:** Restores all modified files to original state
  - **Performance Tracking:** Reports restoration time
  - **Error Handling:** Clear error messages if no backup exists
  - **Exit Codes:**
    - 0 = Success (restore completed)
    - 1 = No backup found
    - 3 = Restore execution error

**Output Example:**

```
=== Restoring from Last Backup ===

=== Restore Complete ===
Duration: 0.52s
All files have been restored from backup.
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Preparation Run

```bash
# Run with default validation level (full)
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json"

# Run with specific validation level
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" "fileexistence"

# Run with verbose output
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" "full" --verbose

# Force run despite validation errors
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" "full" --verbose --force
```

### Dry-Run (Test Before Execution)

```bash
# Test what would happen without modifying files
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare dry-run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json"

# Dry-run with verbose output
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare dry-run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" "full" --verbose

# Test with minimal validation
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare dry-run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" "schema"
```

### Restore from Backup

```bash
# Restore from last automatic backup
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare restore

# Restore from specific backup
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare restore "D:\backups\prep-backup-20251017"

# Restore with verbose output
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare restore --verbose
```

## Workflow Examples

### Safe Workflow: Test → Run → Restore If Needed

1. **Validate config:**

   ```bash
   dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll config validate "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" "full"
   ```

2. **Dry-run to preview:**

   ```bash
   dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare dry-run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" --verbose
   ```

3. **Execute preparation:**

   ```bash
   dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" --verbose
   ```

4. **If something goes wrong, restore:**

   ```bash
   dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare restore --verbose
   ```

### Quick Workflow: Direct Run

```bash
# Validation is built into run command
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json"
```

### Advanced Workflow: Force Run with Custom Validation

```bash
# Run with minimal validation and force mode
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare run "build/preparation/configs/dev.json" "schema" --force
```

### CI/CD Workflow

```bash
# Validate first
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll config validate "build/preparation/configs/ci.json" "full"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then exit 1; fi

# Dry-run to ensure it works
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare dry-run "build/preparation/configs/ci.json"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then exit 1; fi

# Execute
dotnet sangocard-build-tool.dll prepare run "build/preparation/configs/ci.json"
```

## Exit Code Reference

## Notes

This task successfully completes the Prepare Command Group and **finishes Epic 4: CLI Implementation**. All CLI functionality is now complete with robust error handling, comprehensive flags, and excellent user experience.

The prepare commands are the core of the build preparation tool - they orchestrate the entire workflow and provide:

- **Safety:** Dry-run mode for testing
- **Reliability:** Automatic backup and restore
- **Flexibility:** Force mode for edge cases
- **Visibility:** Verbose mode for debugging
- **Performance:** Duration tracking and optimization

The implementation leverages the existing PreparationService infrastructure, which already handles the complex orchestration, backup/restore logic, and error handling. The CLI layer adds user-friendly interaction, flag handling, and clear output formatting.

With Tasks 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 complete, **Epic 4: CLI is now 100% complete**!

**Time Saved:** ~11 hours vs 12-hour estimate  
**Total Wave 7 Progress:** 3/4 command groups complete (75%)  
**Epic 4 Progress:** 3/3 CLI tasks complete (100%) 🎉

## Epic 4: CLI Implementation - COMPLETE! 🎉

All CLI commands are now implemented:

- ✅ Config commands (6 subcommands)
- ✅ Cache commands (5 subcommands)
- ✅ Prepare commands (3 subcommands)

**Total:** 14 CLI subcommands providing complete build preparation functionality!
