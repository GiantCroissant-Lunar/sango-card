## Supported Commands

| Command | Dry-Run Support | Status |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| `config add-source` | ✅ `--dry-run` | Documented |
| `config add-injection` | ✅ `--dry-run` | Documented |
| `config add-batch` | ✅ `--dry-run` | Documented |
| `prepare inject` | ✅ `--dry-run` | Documented |
| `cache populate` | ✅ `--dry-run` | Documented |

## Dry-Run Behavior

### What Dry-Run Does
1. ✅ **Validates** all paths and configurations
2. ✅ **Shows** what would be copied/modified
3. ✅ **Reports** errors that would occur
4. ✅ **Displays** source → destination mappings
5. ✅ **Calculates** file counts and sizes

### What Dry-Run Does NOT Do
1. ❌ **Does not copy** any files
2. ❌ **Does not modify** any configs
3. ❌ **Does not update** any manifests
4. ❌ **Does not change** the client project
5. ❌ **Does not populate** the cache

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Preview Adding Source
```bash
dotnet run -- config add-source \
  --source "projects/code-quality/Library/PackageCache/com.cysharp.unitask@15a4a7657f99" \
  --cache-as "com.cysharp.unitask" \
  --type package \
  --manifest "build/preparation/manifests/third-party-unity-packages.json" \
  --dry-run
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[DRY RUN] Operation: Add source to preparation manifest
  Source: projects/code-quality/Library/PackageCache/com.cysharp.unitask@15a4a7657f99
  Cache As: com.cysharp.unitask
  Type: package
  Manifest: build/preparation/manifests/third-party-unity-packages.json

[DRY RUN] Would copy:
  From: projects/code-quality/Library/PackageCache/com.cysharp.unitask@15a4a7657f99/
  To: build/preparation/cache/com.cysharp.unitask/
  Files: 127 files (2.3 MB)
  Directories: 15

[DRY RUN] Would update manifest:
  + Add item: com.cysharp.unitask (package)

[DRY RUN] No changes made. Remove --dry-run to execute.
```

### Example 2: Preview Batch Operations
```bash
dotnet run -- config add-batch \
  --manifest "build/preparation/batch-examples/batch-add-sources.json" \
  --dry-run
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[DRY RUN] Batch operation preview
  Manifest: build/preparation/batch-examples/batch-add-sources.json
  Operations: 3

[DRY RUN] Operation 1/3: Add source
  Source: projects/code-quality/Library/PackageCache/com.cysharp.messagepipe@fb95a3138269
  Cache As: com.cysharp.messagepipe
  Type: package
  Status: ✓ Valid

[DRY RUN] Operation 2/3: Add source
  Source: projects/code-quality/Library/PackageCache/com.cysharp.r3@fe2216b2d5c4
  Cache As: com.cysharp.r3
  Type: package
  Status: ✓ Valid

[DRY RUN] Operation 3/3: Add source
  Source: projects/code-quality/Assets/Packages/Polly.8.6.2
  Cache As: Polly.8.6.2
  Type: assembly
  Status: ✓ Valid

[DRY RUN] Summary:
  Total operations: 3
  Valid: 3
  Invalid: 0
  Would copy: 8.7 MB

[DRY RUN] No changes made. Remove --dry-run to execute.
```

### Example 3: Preview Preparation Execution
```bash
dotnet run -- prepare inject \
  --config "build/preparation/configs/production.json" \
  --dry-run
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[DRY RUN] Preparation execution preview
  Config: build/preparation/configs/production.json
  Target: projects/client

[DRY RUN] Would inject packages (2):
  1. com.contractwork.sangocard.cross → projects/client/Packages/com.contractwork.sangocard.cross
  2. com.contractwork.sangocard.build → projects/client/Packages/com.contractwork.sangocard.build

[DRY RUN] Would inject assemblies (2):
  1. Polly.8.6.2 → projects/client/Assets/Plugins/Polly.8.6.2
  2. System.Reactive.dll → projects/client/Assets/Plugins/System.Reactive.dll

[DRY RUN] Would apply code patches (1):
  File: projects/client/Assets/Scripts/Config.cs
  Patches: 2

[DRY RUN] Would update scripting symbols:
  Add: PRODUCTION_BUILD, RELEASE_MODE, ENABLE_ANALYTICS
  Remove: DEBUG_MODE, DEVELOPMENT, ENABLE_PROFILER

[DRY RUN] Summary:
  Packages: 2
  Assemblies: 2
  Code patches: 1 file, 2 patches
  Symbol changes: +3, -3
  Total files to copy: 234 files (15.2 MB)

[DRY RUN] No changes made. Remove --dry-run to execute.
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Dry-run flag parsing works correctly
- [ ] Dry-run mode prevents file operations
- [ ] Dry-run mode prevents config modifications
- [ ] Dry-run output format is correct
- [ ] Dry-run validates all paths

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Dry-run with valid sources shows correct preview
- [ ] Dry-run with invalid sources shows errors
- [ ] Dry-run with batch operations shows all operations
- [ ] Dry-run with prepare inject shows complete preview
- [ ] Dry-run followed by real execution works correctly

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run dry-run for each command type
- [ ] Verify no files are copied
- [ ] Verify no configs are modified
- [ ] Verify output is clear and informative
- [ ] Verify errors are reported correctly
- [ ] Verify file counts and sizes are accurate

## Implementation Status

### Phase 2.1: add-source Command
- [x] Dry-run parameter defined
- [x] Dry-run documented in spec
- [x] Dry-run in acceptance criteria

### Phase 2.2: add-injection Command
- [x] Dry-run parameter defined
- [x] Dry-run documented in spec
- [x] Dry-run in acceptance criteria

### Phase 2.3: add-batch Command
- [x] Dry-run parameter defined
- [x] Dry-run documented in spec
- [x] Dry-run in acceptance criteria

### Prepare Inject Command

## Acceptance Criteria

From spec (R-BLD-PREP-021):
- ✅ Dry-run shows preview without applying
- ✅ Dry-run validates paths
- ✅ Dry-run reports errors
- ✅ Dry-run calculates sizes
- ✅ Dry-run works for all commands

## Conclusion

✅ **Verified:** Dry-run feature is fully documented and specified across all relevant documents.

### Documentation Status
- ✅ Specification complete
- ✅ Task document updated with dedicated section
- ✅ User guides include dry-run examples
- ✅ Command examples show dry-run usage
- ✅ Acceptance criteria include dry-run

### Next Steps
1. Implement dry-run mode in CLI commands (Wave 2)
2. Add unit tests for dry-run behavior
3. Add integration tests for dry-run workflows
4. Verify dry-run output format matches spec
5. Update user documentation with actual output examples
