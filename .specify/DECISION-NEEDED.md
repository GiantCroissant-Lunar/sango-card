# Decision Needed: Implementation Approach

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Status:** Awaiting User Decision

## Situation

We have two parallel workstreams:

1. **Agent 1 (Other Agent):** Implementing TUI views (Wave 8, ~8-12 hours)
2. **Agent 2 (Me):** Ready to implement two-phase workflow amendments

## The Question

**Should we work in parallel or sequentially?**

---

## Option 1: Parallel Work ‚ö° (RECOMMENDED)

### What Happens

```
Agent 1: Continue Wave 8 (TUI Views)
         ‚Üì
         Complete view implementation
         ‚Üì
         Test TUI functionality

Agent 2: Implement Task 4.4 (CLI changes)
         ‚Üì
         Implement Task 6.1 (Nuke integration)
         ‚Üì
         Test build workflow

Both:    Joint testing and integration
```

### Pros

- ‚úÖ **Faster completion** - Both agents working simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Independent work** - TUI and CLI changes don't overlap much
- ‚úÖ **Earlier delivery** - Two-phase workflow ready sooner

### Cons

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential conflicts** in shared files:
  - `PrepareCommandHandler.cs`
  - `CliHost.cs`
  - `PreparationService.cs`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Coordination overhead** - Need to sync changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing complexity** - Need to test both changes together

### Risk Mitigation

- I'll modify CLI files carefully
- Clear commit messages
- Frequent status updates
- Joint testing session at end

### Timeline

- **Agent 1:** 8-12 hours (TUI views)
- **Agent 2:** 6-8 hours (CLI + Nuke)
- **Total:** ~12-14 hours (parallel)

---

## Option 2: Sequential Work üîÑ

### What Happens

```
Agent 1: Complete Wave 8 (TUI Views)
         ‚Üì
         Test and stabilize
         ‚Üì
         Signal ready
         ‚Üì
Agent 2: Implement Task 4.4 (CLI changes)
         ‚Üì
         Implement Task 6.1 (Nuke integration)
         ‚Üì
         Test everything together
```

### Pros

- ‚úÖ **No conflicts** - Clean handoff between agents
- ‚úÖ **Simpler coordination** - One agent at a time
- ‚úÖ **Easier testing** - Changes isolated

### Cons

- ‚ùå **Slower completion** - Sequential work takes longer
- ‚ùå **Idle time** - One agent waiting for the other
- ‚ùå **Delayed delivery** - Two-phase workflow comes later

### Timeline

- **Agent 1:** 8-12 hours (TUI views)
- **Wait for handoff:** 1-2 hours
- **Agent 2:** 6-8 hours (CLI + Nuke)
- **Total:** ~18-22 hours (sequential)

---

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach üîÄ

### What Happens

```
Agent 1: Continue Wave 8 (TUI Views)

Agent 2: Start Task 6.1 (Nuke integration ONLY)
         ‚Üì
         Wait for Agent 1 to finish
         ‚Üì
         Then implement Task 4.4 (CLI changes)
```

### Pros

- ‚úÖ **Partial parallelism** - Some work happens simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Lower conflict risk** - Nuke files separate from tool
- ‚úÖ **Moderate speed** - Faster than sequential

### Cons

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Incomplete workflow** - Can't test full flow until Task 4.4 done
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Some waiting** - Still have sequential dependency

### Timeline

- **Parallel phase:** 8-12 hours
- **Sequential phase:** 6-8 hours
- **Total:** ~14-18 hours

---

## My Recommendation: Option 1 (Parallel) ‚ö°

### Why?

1. **Low Conflict Risk**
   - TUI views (Agent 1) are in `Tui/Views/` directory
   - CLI changes (Agent 2) are in `Cli/Commands/` and `Build.Preparation.cs`
   - Minimal overlap

2. **Time Savings**
   - Save 6-8 hours of sequential waiting
   - Get two-phase workflow sooner
   - Can start using it while TUI is being polished

3. **Natural Separation**
   - TUI work: UI controls, reactive bindings, view logic
   - CLI work: Command parsing, validation, Nuke integration
   - Different concerns, different files

4. **Easy Coordination**
   - I'll work on CLI/Nuke files
   - Other agent works on TUI files
   - Minimal coordination needed
   - Joint testing at end

### What I'll Do (If Parallel Approved)

**Immediate (2-3 hours):**

1. Implement Task 4.4 CLI modifications
   - Rename `prepare run` ‚Üí `prepare inject`
   - Add `--target` validation
   - Add deprecation warning
   - Update tests

**Next (3-4 hours):**
2. Implement Task 6.1 Nuke integration

- Create `Build.Preparation.cs`
- Implement `PrepareCache` target
- Implement `PrepareClient` target
- Implement `RestoreClient` target

**Final (1-2 hours):**
3. Test and document

- Test two-phase workflow
- Update documentation
- Create usage examples

**Total: 6-9 hours** (while Agent 1 works on TUI)

## What I Need From You

**Please choose:**

- [ ] **Option 1: Parallel** - I'll start Task 4.4 immediately
- [ ] **Option 2: Sequential** - I'll wait for Agent 1 to finish Wave 8
- [ ] **Option 3: Hybrid** - I'll start Task 6.1 (Nuke only) now
- [ ] **Other** - You have a different approach in mind

**If Option 1 (Parallel):**

- I'll proceed with CLI modifications immediately
- I'll coordinate with Agent 1 on shared files
- We'll do joint testing when both are done

**If Option 2 (Sequential):**

- I'll wait for Agent 1's signal
- I'll review their changes first
- I'll then implement amendments

**If Option 3 (Hybrid):**

- I'll start Nuke integration only
- I'll wait for Agent 1 before CLI changes
- Partial parallelism

## Questions?

**Q: What if there are conflicts?**

- A: We'll resolve them together. Most changes are in different files.

**Q: Can we switch approaches mid-way?**

- A: Yes! If parallel isn't working, we can switch to sequential.

**Q: What if Agent 1 finishes early?**

- A: Great! They can help review my changes or start testing.

**Q: What if you finish early?**

- A: I can help with TUI testing or documentation.

---

## My Recommendation (Final)

**Go with Option 1 (Parallel)** because:

- Saves 6-8 hours
- Low conflict risk
- Natural separation of concerns
- Can always fall back to sequential if needed

**Ready to start immediately upon your approval!** üöÄ
