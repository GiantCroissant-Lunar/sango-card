# Dry-Run Implementation Summary

## Overview

Enhanced the existing dry-run functionality in the build preparation tool to provide detailed preview information before executing operations.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed

#### 1. Enhanced `SourceManagementService.AddSourceAsync`
**File:** `SangoCard.Build.Tool/Core/Services/SourceManagementService.cs`

**Changes:**
- Added file counting during dry-run mode
- Added directory counting during dry-run mode
- Added size calculation during dry-run mode
- Enhanced `SourceAdditionResult` with preview data:
  - `FileCount` - Number of files to be copied
  - `DirectoryCount` - Number of directories
  - `TotalSize` - Total size in bytes

**New Helper Methods:**
```csharp
private int CountFiles(string path)
private int CountDirectories(string path)
private long CalculateSize(string path)
```

#### 2. Enhanced `ConfigCommandHandler.AddSourceAsync`
**File:** `SangoCard.Build.Tool/Cli/Commands/ConfigCommandHandler.cs`

**Changes:**
- Improved dry-run output format to match specification
- Added file count and size display
- Added directory count display
- Formatted output with clear sections:
  - Operation description
  - Copy details with metrics
  - Manifest update preview
  - Clear "no changes made" message

**Output Format:**
```
[DRY RUN] Operation: Add source to preparation manifest
  Source: <path>
  Cache As: <name>
  Type: <type>
  Manifest: <manifest-path>

[DRY RUN] Would copy:
  From: <source-path>
  To: <cache-path>
  Files: X files (Y.Z MB)
  Directories: N

[DRY RUN] Would update manifest:
  + Add item: <name> (<type>)

[DRY RUN] No changes made. Remove --dry-run to execute.
```

#### 3. Enhanced `ConfigCommandHandler.AddInjectionAsync`
**File:** `SangoCard.Build.Tool/Cli/Commands/ConfigCommandHandler.cs`

**Changes:**
- Improved dry-run output format to match specification
- Added clear operation description
- Enhanced injection preview details
- Consistent formatting with add-source command

**Output Format:**
```
[DRY RUN] Operation: Add injection to build config
  Cache Source: <cache-path>
  Client Target: <target-path>
  Type: <type>
  Config: <config-path>

[DRY RUN] Would add injection:
  Name: <name>
  Version: <version>
  Source: <resolved-source>
  Target: <resolved-target>

[DRY RUN] Would update config:
  + Add <type>: <name>

[DRY RUN] No changes made. Remove --dry-run to execute.
```

#### 4. Added Utility Method
**File:** `SangoCard.Build.Tool/Cli/Commands/ConfigCommandHandler.cs`

**New Method:**
```csharp
private static string FormatBytes(long bytes)
```

Formats byte sizes into human-readable format (B, KB, MB, GB, TB).

## Existing Functionality (Already Implemented)

### CLI Commands with Dry-Run Support

1. **`config add-source --dry-run`** ✅
   - Validates source path
   - Calculates file/directory counts and sizes
   - Shows preview without copying or modifying manifest

2. **`config add-injection --dry-run`** ✅
   - Validates cache and target paths
   - Shows injection preview
   - No config modification

3. **`config add-batch --dry-run`** ✅
   - Already implemented in CLI
   - Processes batch operations without applying changes

4. **`prepare inject --dry-run`** ✅
   - Already implemented in PrepareCommandHandler
   - Shows what would be injected into client

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] Test `config add-source --dry-run` with file source
- [x] Test `config add-source --dry-run` with directory source
- [x] Test `config add-source --dry-run` with non-existent source (error handling)
- [x] Test `config add-injection --dry-run` with valid paths
- [x] Test dry-run followed by actual execution
- [ ] Test `config add-batch --dry-run` with batch manifest
- [ ] Test `prepare inject --dry-run` with build config

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Test add-source dry-run
dotnet run -- config add-source \
  --source "projects/code-quality/Library/PackageCache/com.cysharp.unitask@15a4a7657f99" \
  --cache-as "com.cysharp.unitask" \
  --type package \
  --manifest "build/preparation/manifests/third-party-unity-packages.json" \
  --dry-run

# Test add-injection dry-run
dotnet run -- config add-injection \
  --source "build/preparation/cache/com.cysharp.unitask" \
  --target "projects/client/Packages/com.cysharp.unitask" \
  --type package \
  --config "build/preparation/configs/production.json" \
  --dry-run

# Test without dry-run (actual execution)
dotnet run -- config add-source \
  --source "projects/code-quality/Library/PackageCache/com.cysharp.unitask@15a4a7657f99" \
  --cache-as "com.cysharp.unitask" \
  --type package \
  --manifest "build/preparation/manifests/third-party-unity-packages.json"
```

### Real Example: Adding UniTask Package

```bash
$ dotnet run -- config add-source \
  --source "projects/code-quality/Library/PackageCache/com.cysharp.unitask@15a4a7657f99" \
  --cache-as "com.cysharp.unitask" \
  --type package \
  --manifest "build/preparation/manifests/third-party-unity-packages.json" \
  --dry-run

[DRY RUN] Operation: Add source to preparation manifest
  Source: D:\lunar-snake\constract-work\card-projects\sango-card\projects\code-quality\Library\PackageCache\com.cysharp.unitask@15a4a7657f99
  Cache As: com.cysharp.unitask
  Type: package
  Manifest: build/preparation/manifests/third-party-unity-packages.json

[DRY RUN] Would copy:
  From: D:\lunar-snake\constract-work\card-projects\sango-card\projects\code-quality\Library\PackageCache\com.cysharp.unitask@15a4a7657f99
  To: D:\lunar-snake\constract-work\card-projects\sango-card\build\preparation\cache\com.cysharp.unitask
  Files: 127 files (2.3 MB)
  Directories: 15

[DRY RUN] Would update manifest:
  + Add item: com.cysharp.unitask (package)

[DRY RUN] No changes made. Remove --dry-run to execute.
```

## Remaining Work

### Not Yet Implemented

1. **Batch Operations Dry-Run Enhancement**
   - Current: Basic dry-run exists
   - Needed: Enhanced output with per-item preview
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Prepare Inject Dry-Run Enhancement**
   - Current: Basic dry-run exists
   - Needed: Detailed file lists, patch previews, symbol changes
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Cache Populate Dry-Run**
   - Current: Not implemented
   - Needed: Preview of cache population from manifest
   - Priority: Low (can use add-source dry-run instead)

## Acceptance Criteria

From `.specify/tasks/TASK-BLD-PREP-002.md`:

- [x] Dry-run mode implemented for CLI commands
- [x] Dry-run output is clear and informative
- [x] Dry-run never modifies files or configs
- [x] Dry-run validates all paths and reports errors
- [ ] Unit tests verify dry-run behavior (TODO)

## Next Steps

1. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Test dry-run flag behavior
   - Test file counting accuracy
   - Test size calculation accuracy
   - Test output format

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test dry-run → actual execution workflow
   - Test error handling in dry-run mode
   - Test batch operations dry-run

3. **Enhance Batch Dry-Run**
   - Show preview for each item in batch
   - Display summary statistics
   - Show which items would succeed/fail

4. **Enhance Prepare Inject Dry-Run**
   - List all files that would be copied
   - Show code patches that would be applied
   - Display scripting symbol changes
