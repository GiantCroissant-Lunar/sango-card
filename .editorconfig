# C# Code Style Rules
[*.cs]
# Partial class organization (R-CODE-090)
# When implementing multiple interfaces, use separate partial class files
# File naming: ClassName.InterfaceName.cs (without 'I' prefix from interface name)
# Example: Build.cs has "partial class Build : NukeBuild"
#          Build.UnityBuild.cs has "partial class Build : IUnityBuild"
# Interface members should be implemented in the interface-specific partial file
# Note: This is a convention enforced by code review and analyzer (see R-CODE-090)

# Unity MessagePack analyzer override (non-invasive per R-BLD-060)
# The Unity client (projects/client) currently fails with MsgPack009 due to duplicate generated formatters.
# We cannot modify the client repo directly (R-BLD-060), so downgrade the diagnostic at the root to allow builds.
# Keep surfaced as a warning so the issue remains visible in logs.
